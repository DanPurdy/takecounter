# Takecounter
===========

JQuery based takecounter for use in a Recording studio environment, or indeed anywhere requiring a take counter!

Incorporates takes and passes (currently restricted to 999 of each in that configuration).
Also incorporates a take only mode (no passes and full width. Take limit is 999999 in this config)

The limits can easily be changed, I just selected these limits to meet the balance between useful font size and space used.

I personally use this off of a Raspberry Pi with a usb numpad attached either via the video out or the hdmi out.
Responsive design so it should adjust to different resolutions correctly depending on your setup.


Currently set to work with a numpad.

Controls can be seen in **controls.txt**

To edit the controls just edit the defaults within the scripts file by adding the correct key code. 

Customisable controls may be added as a feature in the future if requested.
